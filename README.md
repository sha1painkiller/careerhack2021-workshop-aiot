## Avnet MT3620 Start Kit
The Avnet Azure Sphere MT3620 Starter Kit supports rapid prototyping of highly secure, end-to-end IoT implementations using Microsoftâ€™s Azure Sphere. The small form-factor carrier board includes a production-ready MT3620 Sphere module with WiFi connectivity, along with multiple expansion interfaces for easy integration of off-the-shelf sensors, displays, motors, relays, and more.

On-board sensors
- 3-Axis accelerometer
- 3-Axis gyro
- Temperature
- Pressure/Barometric
- status LEDs
- 3 * buttons

## Azure Sphere Vision Kit
The Azure Sphere Vision Kit was built by Microsoft AED Taiwan engineering team. It integrated a QVGA mono camera sensor to facilitate vision applications. The kit can connect to the internet through its embedded dual-band Wi-Fi. An additional NFC module is also integrated to accelerate device provisioning and near-field communication.

On-board sensors
- Mono QVGA camera sensor
- NFC
- status LEDs
